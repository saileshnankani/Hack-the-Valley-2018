Project Name: Virtual Shopping. Online stores use text search to find you products, however, there is no tool that searches products and services from pictures you take on your smartphone or any other image you find on the internet. In this web app, images are analyzed for their content, which is then subsequently used to determine and return the location of nearby products and services. 

Our project uses Clarifai API for image recognition and Google's Places API for the location of products. This project was developed for Hack-the-Valley 2018.
