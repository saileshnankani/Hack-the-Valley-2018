#Description
Online stores use text search to find you products, however, there is no tool that searches products and services from pictures you take on your smartphone or any other image you find on the internet. In this web app, images are analyzed for their content, which is then subsequently used to determine and return the location of nearby products and services. 

#How we built it
We used Clarifai API for image recognition and Google Places API for location services. The web application was built in Python.

#What's next for Virtual Shopping
Developing a intuitive user interface and integrating payments API so the buying process is convenient and seamless.

This project was developed for Hack-the-Valley 2018.
